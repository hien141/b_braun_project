Write a script that converts an image file from .bmp to .png.
Requirements:
1.	Do the conversion inside a docker container.
2.	Write a separate script for creating the docker image.
3.	Ensure that the files and/or directories created are owned by the user executing the script.
4.	Create a shared library for Jenkins that provides a step for the conversion, and uses the container to convert the file.
5.	Track your work in a git repository (with reasonably sized commits).
